## Javascript Project Proposal

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that uses color pixels to represent elements in a numbered array.

Users will be able to choose an algorithm and watch the colors align into a rainbow-ish display, and buttons on the side will allow them to toggle between different options and perhaps to control speed of animation.

The app will have a single screen with the main visualization window, sorting choices and a timer on the left, and nav links to my information below.
