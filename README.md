## Javascript Project Proposal

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that uses color pixels to represent elements in a numbered array.

Users will be able to choose an algorithm and watch the colors align into a rainbow-ish display, and buttons on the side will allow them to toggle between different options and perhaps to control speed of animation.

The app will have a single screen with the main visualization window, sorting choices and a timer on the left, and nav links to my information below.

* Quick Sort
* Selection Sort
* Counting Sort

### Timeline

* Day 1: write code for algorithms and basic setup
* Day 2: work on rendering display
* Day 3: continue with rendering, toggling, timer
* Days 4-5: finish remaining + styling
